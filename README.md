🎮 Lights Out — JavaFX Puzzle Game

Lights Out is an interactive logic-based puzzle game implemented in JavaFX, featuring a responsive 5×5 grid of toggleable lights. The objective is simple yet challenging — turn off all the lights using the least number of moves, where toggling one light affects its adjacent tiles.

🧩 Features:

Built a JavaFX GUI with dynamic button-based grid and visual state updates.

Integrated a custom model-view-observer architecture for reactive UI updates.

Added hint generation and board randomization to enhance replayability.

Implemented file loading functionality for saving and resuming game states.

Displays move tracking and visual feedback (color-coded lights, hint highlights).

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Java, JavaFX, OOP, MVC Architecture, File I/O

📈 What I Learned:
Developing this project deepened my understanding of GUI design patterns, event-driven programming, and modular architecture in Java applications. I also refined my problem-solving and debugging skills while optimizing grid-based logic for responsiveness.
